# Matching Parens

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that accepts a string containing parentheses. The function should return `true` if every parenthesis has a matching parenthesis, otherwise return `false`.

## Instructions

- Open [Unsolved/matching-parens.js](Unsolved/matching-parens.js) in your code editor -- **this is the only file you will modify in this activity.**

  - In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `matchingParens` function to achieve the following:

    - Loop through the given string and determine if every left parenthesis `(` has a matching right parenthesis `)` and vice-versa.

    - If every parenthesis has a matching parenthesis, return `true`. Otherwise return `false`.

    - For example, given the following str:

    ```js
    var str = "Math.floor(Math.random() * 10";
    ```

    - The function should return `false`, as there is a missing right parenthesis.

- You can check to see if your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  - Functions that _pass_ the tests will be denoted with a **green check mark**.

  - Functions that _fail_ the tests will be denoted with a **red x and an error message**.

# De String Map

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that takes in a stringMap object and returns a regular string.

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/de-string-map.js](Unsolved/de-string-map.js) in your code editor -- **this is the only file you will modify in this activity.**

  * In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `deStringMap` function to achieve the following:

    * Return a regular string from the stringMap object.

    * For example, given the following object:

    ```js
    var obj = { "H": [0], "T": [1], "M": [2], "L": [3], " ": [4, 6], "&": [5], "C": [7], "S": [8, 9] };
    ```

    * The following string should be returned:

    ```js
    "HTML & CSS"
    ```

    * **You may want to complete the previous `string-map` problem before attempting this one.**

* You can check to see if your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  * Functions that _pass_ the tests will be denoted with a **green check mark**.

  * Functions that _fail_ the tests will be denoted with a **red x and an error message**.

### Hints

* Take your time understanding the problem before you attempt to solve it. Try to work it out on paper before you write any code.

* You may want to complete the previous `string-map` problem before attempting this one.

# What is an algorithm?

> "An algorithm is a detailed step-by-step instruction set or formula for solving a problem or completing a task. In computing, programmers write algorithms that instruct the computer how to perform a task."

If you're learning JavaScript, chances are, you've already written a few algorithms. Anytime you've ever written a function that that completed a task or turned data into other data, you used an algorithm.

## Why Do I Need To Practice Algorithms?

When most people begin programming, they often have incorrect assumptions about what's important to learn or how to study. Many spend hours focusing on memorizing syntax. A comma here, a parenthesis here, a semi-colon here. While learning the basic language syntax is important, it doesn't do much to help you think like an engineer.

Programmers don't get paid to code. They get paid to solve problems with code.

By practicing algorithm problems you'll master your programming language more quickly, be better equipped to break down and solve unfamiliar problems, and perform better during technical interviews?

## Technical Interviews?

Many technical interviews will involve some form of solving algorithm problems. This might happen in a code editor or on a whiteboard.

Interviewing for jobs may seem far off now, but it takes some time to become competent at these types of interview problems. Luckily we can get started right away.

## How to Practice These Problems

### Start With PseudoCoding

If you can't solve a problem without code, you can't solve a problem with code.

Make sure you understand the problem. Read it out loud to yourself, pretend to explain it to someone else. Too often even experienced developers misunderstand the problem they're facing and come to a solution for an entirely different problem.

### Pseudocode

Spend a few minutes working with pencil and paper, writing out the problem on paper. Writing out the steps your code needs to take. Illustrate how each step brings you closer to a solution. This step is often skipped but is **essential** as problems grow in complexity. Do this even if the problem feels simple, it will also better prepare you for interviews where you need to talk out your thought process.

### Attempt the Problem

These problems aren't meant to be solved quickly. Refrain from looking at the solved versions until you've spent at least a few hours trying to work out the solution for yourself.

### Study the Solution

If you weren't able to complete the problem on your own after working on it for a few hours, take some time to study the solution. Make sure you understand how it works, ask your instructor or a TA if you're confused.

If you were able to complete the problem, study the solution anyway. There are many ways to solve a problem, compare your solution to the one provided.

### Revisit the Problem

Revisit the problem in a few days and attempt to solve it. It should be easier this time. Keep coming back to review it every few days.
